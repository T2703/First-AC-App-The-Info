# First AC App The Info
I love racing games and Assetto Corsa is one of them. After learning that developing applications use Python I figured, why not try to learn how apps are made for this game and see what I can do. I studied some source code and read a fourm about developing apps and I was able to piece something together that reads your cars data like the RPM, speed, the gearing, tire pressure, gas, and turbo (if the car has one). Overall I do want to get more engaged with Assetto Corsa app development and see what else I can make it's been pretty fun and I like it.

So, what does this app do? It basically gets the data from your car and spits out the information of your car like how much fuel do you have or how fast you are going, or what gear you are in, etc. I explained some of it in the first part of this readme. While it is basic, this is my first app to be fair I have not messed around with making graphics for apps at the moment I do have an idea on how it works behind the scenes but I'm not too keen with how to make them work with graphics nor do I know how to design graphics anyways. Yeah, that's pretty much what the app does here are the features stating them.

Features:
- Shows what gear you are in.
- Shows the speed and depending on your units selected displays it in MPH or KMH.
- Fuel of the car.
- Tire pressures of each tire.
- Amount of turbo boost the car is outputting if your car has a turbo otherwise it just stays 0.

Running the app:
- Install the app.
- Extract the file. 
- Find your AC directory.
- Find the apps folders.
- Put the file into the python folder.
Another way:
- Install the app.
- Extract the file (if you want to).
- Drag and drop the file into Content Manager (make sure that it is opened).
- Install in there.
- Go to the contents tab.
- Go to apps.
- Make sure First App is activated.

I guess if you did the first way and have CM you don't have to install it in CM you can just activate it. 

Overall, I do hope to learn more about AC app development and to put out other cool stuff I suppose.
